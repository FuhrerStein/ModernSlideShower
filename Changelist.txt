-- Planned functionality and changes --
show compression and decompression progress when saving/loading lists
program icon
filelist position indicator
explain about jpegtran in case it was not found
interface to adjust curves
filtering image with glsl code
support for large images by splitting them into smaller subtextures
seam resizing with glsl
set settings change speeds in setting settings
add 3-4 user-editable parameters to mandelbrot_mode
add other julia sets in mandelbrot_mode
render mandelbrot to subtextures for reuse between frames (caching for mandelbrot texels)
tutorial mode to teach user how to use program
avoid swapping textures every frame
"repeat last levels" single-key operation
rewrite help for other modes: levels, transform, mandelbrot
transition settings for next image, next folder, and first image in list
do not switch immediately at edges in compare mode
in compare mode move splitter faster near center of the screen
in thumbs mode show which photos are accepted and rejected
in thumbs mode limit horizontal movement
animate thumbnails rearrangement when unzooming

advanced ultra-zoom algorithm

Scroll mode. Show all images in one scroll with equal width and equal zoom
Zoom mode. Switch to next image with extreme zoom on previous. Also in slideshow.

read-only mode
levels: contrast regulation
Switch all db to pandas (bad idea - slow)
low-power mandelbrot-like mode, also shown when no images left.




-- Implemented functionality and changes --

in thumbs mode minimal stack to be 3 thumbs in width
image precaching
in case of deep unzoom, show thumbnails
load preview thumbnails in separate process
choose another image by zooming into its thumbnail
add accept/reject selector in compare mode
eliminate gesture mode
exit program if all images are moved away
save settings to file
Accept/reject mode, aka tinder mode. Swipe Up/Down to switch to previous/next image.
            Swipe Left/Rigth to move it to "-"/"+" category.
            Use M or C to move or copy categorized image.
            Show counters of rejected/uncategorized/accepted in the upper center of the screen
            In the couters highlight category to which current image belongs to
            Show animation when image has been assigned to a category
irregular smooth borders
report how many times over all images were shown during program run
show random unshown image
compare mode (left-right)
menu with common functions by left click
shortening of permanent messages to single letter
touchpad mode - swipe to switch and move files
switch animation gets faster is case of fast image switching
vibrance (soft saturation) correction along with levels
pre-levels saturation
ensure transition animation starts after image is fully loaded
smooth mandelbrot auto mode
in mandel auto travel add a bit of randomness
mandel_travel must choose target coordinate instead of speed
saturation correction along with levels
smooth animation when apply crop
when rotating, crop with widest possible borders
choose even not visible border for cropping
generate picture coordinates on the fly
correlate transition speed with actual flipping rate
intuitive centering during unzoom
dialog to edit settings
use 4-point sampling to generate fake texture on extreme zoom
keyboard navigation on picture
image resizing in full edit mode
image rotation in full edit mode
automatic travel in mandelbrot mode
double-double presision calculation for mandelbrot_mode
lossy image cropping in full edit mode
make mandelbrot_mode eye candy
basic live mandelbrot when no images found
decompress list file
compress list file
generalize settings
jump to random folder (not image)
jump to random image in same folder
simple blur during transition
if jpegtan was not found, do not show message to save rotation
sticking of enable/disable levels key
swap levels adjustments: put gamma min and max, adjust gamma with l+r mouse
do not apply borders when apply levels
replace simple pop messages with full-fledged messages queue
levels edit with left and right mouse
show short image info
navigate through levels interface with only mouse
navigate through settings by mouse
adjustable between-image transition
do not regenerate empty image if it is already there
nice empty image
save 90Â°-rotation when saving edited image
autoflip mode
smooth image change
random image jump from mouse
self.pressed_mouse must support middle button with other buttons
show friendly message in case no images are found
start with random image if playlist had _r in its name
pleasant image centering
show message when changing folder
simple slidelist compression to reduce file size.
make image sharpest possible using right mipmap texture
show message when ending list
update histograms on the fly
save edited image
interface to adjust levels
different color levels
mouse action for left+right drag
help message on F1 or H
free image rotation
rotate indicator
