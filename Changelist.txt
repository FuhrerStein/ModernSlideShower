-- Implemented functionality and changes --

add accept/reject selector in compare mode
eliminate gesture mode
exit program if all images are moved away
save settings to file
Accept/reject mode, aka tinder mode. Swipe Up/Down to switch to previous/next image.
            Swipe Left/Rigth to move it to "-"/"+" category.
            Use M or C to move or copy categorized image.
            Show counters of rejected/uncategorized/accepted in the upper center of the screen
            In the couters highlight category to which current image belongs to
            Show animation when image has been assigned to a category
irregular smooth borders
report how many times over all images were shown during program run
show random unshown image
compare mode (left-right)
menu with common functions by left click
shortening of permanent messages to single letter
touchpad mode - swipe to switch and move files
switch animation gets faster is case of fast image switching
vibrance (soft saturation) correction along with levels
pre-levels saturation
ensure transition animation starts after image is fully loaded
smooth mandelbrot auto mode
in mandel auto travel add a bit of randomness
mandel_travel must choose target coordinate instead of speed
saturation correction along with levels
smooth animation when apply crop
when rotating, crop with widest possible borders
choose even not visible border for cropping
generate picture coordinates on the fly
correlate transition speed with actual flipping rate
intuitive centering during unzoom

automatic travel in mandelbrot mode
double-double presision calculation for mandelbrot_mode
lossy image cropping in full edit mode
make mandelbrot_mode eye candy
basic live mandelbrot when no images found
decompress list file
compress list file
generalize settings
jump to random folder (not image)
jump to random image in same folder
simple blur during transition
if jpegtan was not found, do not show message to save rotation
sticking of enable/disable levels key
swap levels adjustments: put gamma min and max, adjust gamma with l+r mouse
do not apply borders when apply levels
replace simple pop messages with full-fledged messages queue
levels edit with left and right mouse
show short image info
navigate through levels interface with only mouse
navigate through settings by mouse

save edited image
interface to adjust levels
different color levels
mouse action for left+right drag
help message on F1 or H
free image rotation
rotate indicator
